Powers: Can cast spells using any programming language‚ÄîPython for elemental magic, JavaScript for illusions, C++ for combat spells. Weakness: Overcomplicates simple problems and struggles with interpersonal relationships. Key relationships: Best friend to Aria, romantic tension with Marcus. Backstory: Her parents were killed by a Corruption attack on ByteHaven's server farms when she was 20, driving her quest for revenge."

Powers: Wields crystallized algorithms as weapons‚Äîsorting spells that can organize chaos into order, encryption shields that deflect magical attacks, and debugging swords that can 'fix' corrupted enemies. Weakness: His rigid moral code sometimes prevents flexible thinking. Key relationships: Respects Zara's abilities but clashes with her methods, protective of Aria. Backstory: His sister was absorbed by the Corruption, and he joined the knights to find a way to save her soul from the digital void."

They discover the Corruption isn't random‚Äîit's being directed by someone with deep knowledge of both magic and programming. Their investigation leads them to the abandoned servers of TechnoMagic Corp, where they find logs suggesting the Corruption was once human.
