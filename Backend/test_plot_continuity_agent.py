        Sarah Morrison, 28, stood at the edge of the cliff overlooking Lighthouse Cove. 
        As a marine biologist, she had always loved the ocean, despite losing her parents 
        in a sailing accident when she was 16. Her blue eyes reflected the stormy waters 
        below as she thought about her research on coral reef restoration.
        
        Marcus Chen, the lighthouse keeper, approached from behind. "Sarah, what brings 
        you here so late?" he asked. They had been dating for three years, ever since 
        she moved to the village to start her research station.
        
        "I got the letter," she whispered, holding up an envelope. "The one about the 
        real reason my parents died. It wasn't an accident, Marcus. Someone sabotaged 
        their boat."
        
        The lighthouse beam swept across the water every thirty seconds, just as it 
        had for the past 150 years since the lighthouse was built in 1873.

        self.chapter_2 = """
        Three days later, Sarah, now 29, sat in the Driftwood Cafe with her best friend 
        Emma, a fellow scientist. Her green eyes were red from crying as she explained 
        the shocking revelation about her parents' death when she was 15.
        
        "I can't believe someone would do that," Emma said, stirring her coffee. 
        "Have you told Marcus?"
        
        "Marcus is acting strange," Sarah replied. "Yesterday he seemed to know more 
        than he was letting on. And I found out something else - the lighthouse has 
        only been automated for 50 years, since 1975. Before that, keepers lived 
        there full-time."
        
        Outside, storm clouds gathered over Rocky Harbor (the locals' name for the 
        town), promising another night of rain. Sarah's phone buzzed - a text from 
        Dr. Williams, her research partner who she hadn't seen in months.
        """
        
        self.chapter_3 = """
        A week later, Sarah confronted Marcus at the lighthouse. The automated beacon 
        had been malfunctioning, casting its light every minute instead of every 
        thirty seconds.
        
        "You knew about my parents, didn't you?" she accused, her brown eyes flashing 
        with anger. "That's why you've been avoiding me for the past two weeks."
        
        Marcus, 35, ran his hands through his hair. As the town's photographer and 
        part-time lighthouse maintenance worker, he had access to old records. 
        
        "I found documents in the lighthouse archives," he admitted. "Your parents 
        were investigating something big. Something that certain people in Harbor 
        Point didn't want exposed."
        
        Thunder crashed overhead as Sarah processed this information. She thought 
        about Emma, who had mysteriously left town yesterday without saying goodbye, 
        and about Dr. Williams, who never responded to her messages.
